Developed by Dan Olson

Features:

- Uses the fast and popular ESP32 (castellated via version) development board as the main controller. These boards are fairly low cost and provide wifi,bluetooth and various other onboard functions.

- 16 pin (7 with pin out functionality) castellated breakout board footprint for development,research and testing of ideas.

- Small,lightweight and can be used on professional projects too.

- With some soldering practice, the module boards are easy to solder in place.

- Low cost and robust.

- One onboard led for testing.

- Plenty of ground and 3.3v out.

- Set of 16 additional pins broken out to pin headers for normal use.

Programming:

Programming is without usb functionality, on further iterations I may consider expanding the board edge to add a usb port with a cp2102.

TODO:

Order and test first iteration of board
Label all important pins
Write a small testing script to demonstrate functionality
Develop and design the first attach board and test it.

Developed by Dan Olson


Features:

- Uses the fast and popular ESP32 (castellated via version) development board as the main controller. These boards are fairly low cost and provide wifi,bluetooth among various other onboard functions.

- Same dimensions as the 40 pin header system on the raspberry pi A+, so it should also fit within the bounds of the raspberry pi 3.  

- 40 pin breakout is met with an SDA/SCL I2C jumper to the TCA9548 I2C expander chip. Esp32's onboard I2C also has a route to the 40 pin header, although it does not have a configurable jumper.

- SPI bus is also direct connected (without jumpers to the 40 pin header.

- TCA9548 breaks out to 4 sets of 2 pins each for extra I2C connectivity.
 
- I2C and SPI connection to 40 pin header provide the ability to create a product line of inexpensive expander hat's that could potentially be reused on both this product and raspberry pi's, creating a unique reusuable and modular system of hats.

- Existing hats can possibly be used if cognizant of exisitng connections and proper testing and research is performed first. At the very least you can simply attach a board (if it is powered by 3.3v) and make a connection to the onboard I2C headers.

- 8 pwm/multifunction ports are broken out into a 2 by 4 header that has been strategically placed near the 4 i2c port headers. Hopefully, this is a good spot, so that a raspberry pi w sized "ESP32 attach board" can make use of these ports. In addition, two extra boards have been broken in a seperate headers for a total of 10 I/O ports.

- A micro usb port has been added to the port to provide a way to program the chip. This uses the CP2102.

- Board is a 2 layer to reduce costs.

- One onboard led for programming and 2 additional onboard led's for tx/rx communication on the cp2102 chip.


Additional Planned Features:

- Add a led power indicator

- Add an extra onboard I2C sensor for the one unused i2c port. This is only if space permits. Some ideas: extra temperature sensor, cryptographic chip ith additional RNG or an extra eeprom (possibly ferroelectric ram)


TODO:

Order and test first iteration of board
Label all important pins
Write a small testing script to demonstrate functionality
Develop and design the first attach board and test it.
Work on planned features


Other potential issues that need testing:

Testing of the power system to a seperate HAT will be the first order of business to ensure I designed that correctly.

Testing multiple I2C connections simultaneously and making sure signal integreity is exceptional or at least adequate (it is a two layer board).
